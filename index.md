## X&Y's Blog

### Introduction

Feeling excited to build my personal blog here.

























##### Technique Reminder
- Having trouble with Pages? Check out [documentation](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact).
- Use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Sylvia1423/jekyll-now/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
- GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
- Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Sylvia1423/jekyll-now/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
